= Rmqbeat Docs

Rmqbeat allows to read messages over AMQP (from RabbitMQ or other server) and post them to Elasticsearch, Logstash, etc.

It preserves both payload and properties including headers.

It also supports `tracer` mode, which is designed to connect to `amq.rabbitmq.trace` node and receive trace messages activity.
In this mode it publishes message as it was sent (with original properties) and adds some additional information such as username, action performed (publish|deliver), etc.

It can also serve as a RabbitMQ log shipper when you subscribe to `amq.rabbitmq.log` exchange.
