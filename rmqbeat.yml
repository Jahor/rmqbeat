rmqbeat:
  consumers:
      # The name of the queue rmqbeat will consume events from. If
      # left empty, a transient queue with an randomly chosen name
      # will be created.
    - queue.name: queue_name
      # The name of the exchange rmqbeat will bind queue to. If
      # left empty, rmqbeat will not bind to any exchange
      exchange.name: exchange.name
	  # The routing key to use when binding a queue to the exchange.
	  # This is only relevant for direct or topic exchanges.
